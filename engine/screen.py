screen.py — batch durability screener.

Routes each ticker:
  - Operating equities (10-K domestic or 20-F/40-F FPI) → durability scorecard + growth signals
  - Funds (N-CSR/N-PORT/N-1A/485BPOS/485APOS forms, SIC 6726, or yfinance quoteType
    ETF/MUTUALFUND) → ETF lens section
  - Unknown/unclassified → flagged row, not scored
  - Network / data failures → logged, run continues; one bad ticker never kills the run

Classification is evidence-based (B1): determined from the SEC submissions form history,
not inferred from absent fundamentals.  A company whose XBRL concepts all fail to resolve
is still classified operating if it filed 10-K or 20-F.

For tickers absent from EDGAR (ETFs, most CEFs), yfinance quoteType is used as a *second*
evidence source:
  - quoteType ETF or MUTUALFUND → route to ETF lens
  - quoteType EQUITY or yfinance failure → route to Excluded ("not classifiable as fund")
  Never classify as fund from EDGAR absence alone.

Analyst overrides (B2) in config.classification.overrides win over inference
and over the financial-issuer SIC exclusion.

Sort modes
----------
--sort durability     : ranked by durability composite (highest first)
--sort quality-value  : ranked by (composite_percentile − gap_percentile) within the batch.
                        High durability AND low/negative expectations gap → top rank.
                        Companies without a solvable expectations gap are ranked last.
